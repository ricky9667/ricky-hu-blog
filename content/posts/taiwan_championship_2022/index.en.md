It has been a long time since I posted for a competition, But I kind of want to document my life down, therefore I wrote this post just after the comp lol

## Before the competition

In fact, I was struggling pretty much the week before the competition. There are many tasks that have a very early deadline for my internship and university, and I had a stomachache for several days.

Thankfully, several tasks has been pushed forward a lot, and my stomach is almost healed, so I still went to the competition :D

## Competition results

I participated in 3x3„ÄÅ2x2„ÄÅ4x4„ÄÅ5x5„ÄÅMegaminx„ÄÅand 3x3 OHÔºåbut I only got PRs for Megaminx, which is pretty bad in my opinion üò¢

[My results](https://live.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/1828/competitors/180675)

- Megaminx Single: 1:22.79 ‚Üí 1:10.08
- Megaminx Average: 1:32.59 ‚Üí 1:21.63

### 3x3

Not performing well these days, I was like 2 seconds slower than my normal average.

I had a hard time finding the first pair during inspection, so I didn't get good results unfortunately.

### 2x2

I did not practice 2x2 at all, but got a sub 4 in the 2nd round.
However it is too hard to get into 2x2 finals with a sub 4 average :P

### 4x4

For the 1st round I got too many parities, so the results weren't good. Even though it was quite better for the 2nd round, I got a counting 42 so I failed to get a PR in average.

Besides, during a solve in the 2nd round, I saw a black dot on my cube when I was solving the cubing, then I realized my cube was marked by a pen accidentally. I decided to let this go after erasing that mark on my cube and waited for the next solve, but then I saw another NEW mark on my cube during inspection, so I called the delegate after finishing this solve. I got at extra solve but I still got an 42 :P

### 5x5

1:10 average for the 1st round, cannot really focus on my cube, so only my 1:02 was a bit better.

For the 2nd round, the first 2 solves weren't that good, but the last 3 solves I had good inspection, I think I actually have a chance to get a sub 60 for these solves. Hope I can get an official sub 60 ASAP

### Megaminx

My megaminx was about 15 seconds faster after the previous comp, therefore it is predictable to get PRs for this event. Unfortunately I flipped my corner in 2 solves, which I think I would've get a sub 80 average if this didn't happen :(

Besides, shoutout to  [Wayne Pi](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2017PIWA01) who taught me several tips for megaminx, even my cube was borrowed from him, I really improved a lot because of his guidance.

### 3x3 OH

Performing pretty bad in OH, I don't know why there are so many lock ups on my TengYun this day.
Maybe I used up all of my luck from my 10.29 single in January.

## Other details

### Staff

I applied for staff in this competition, I was staying at the submit cube area, almost every cuber passed by me.

Even though I don't need to walk around that much, but I was still standing a lot, therefore my legs were exhausted after the competition.

Another interesting thing to mention is that I was one of the runner at 3x3 finals, the stage makes a large sound when people walk on it, so I was afraid if I will affect the finalists lol

### Competitors

Besides Taiwanese competitors, a lot of foreign cubers came to attend the Taiwan Championship, such as [Seung Hyuk Nahm](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013NAHM01), [Tomohiro Kobayashi](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013KOBA01), [Makoto Takaoka](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013TAKA02), [Masayuki Hirai](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014HIRA05), and Megaminx god [Tristan](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016YONG02), which makes the competition a lot more difficult than before.

I have to mention that [Seung Hyuk Nahm](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013NAHM01) is really friendly and talkative, many Taiwanese cubers (fans?) went to chat with him. I also [Tomohiro Kobayashi](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013KOBA01) for some travel recommendations in Tokyo and Osaka (because I am going there next month). I felt so good to meet these cubers, therefore I am grateful that I didn't give up this comp.

## My impressions

The results affected my feelings pretty much, I was actually feeling so bad for several times, but the interaction with other cubers make me calm down and feel a lot better, especially chatting with foreign cubers.

I still have to thank the organizers and core staff, I can feel that the schedule was tight, and the organizers need to deal with many situations, it was a lot easier for me to stay at the submit area. I hope more and more people can invest in this great community.
